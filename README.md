# Evan Caldwell (evcaldwe)
I am currently a Senior at Indiana University, scheduled to graduate in May of 2020. I'm 
from Fort Wayne Indiana, where I went to school at Homestead High School. 
I'm an Informatics major with a business cognate with experience in SQL, Python, HTML, and 
In-design. My hobbies include computer building, weightlifting, football, 
and gaming. I love animals, and I'm a huge fan of IU sports. **GO HOOSIERS!**
